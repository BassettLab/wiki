## How to schedule lab meetings

* Before the start of each summer
  * If the day and time need to change to accomodate lab members, ask Dani to schedule a time.
  * Ask Dani to fill out the lab meeting schedule [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wP-qfEmRAeGFi57mPcKTtDq8O70Ye1DfNsgnVXcc2Ms/edit).
  * If there are empty spots on the schedule, email the lab to fill out spots that they want.
  * Update on the lab calendar.
* Email the lab about the lab meeting the week before the meeting at the lab email [listserv](mailto:bassettlab@lists.seas.upenn.edu). Include who is presenting, when, where, and why (ie is it a practice talk for a job talk or a defense?). Optionally, ask the presenter to reply to the email with a title and a description of the talk.
* Occasionally, ask the people who presented already to upload their slides to our lab [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/pmwtls3zn53dhz4las2fl/h?dl=0&rlkey=3lx2f7mbpa4sazmvltoup9zbb).
